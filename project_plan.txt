| This document is designed to help the user properly plan their molecular   |
| dynamics experiments.  We encourage users to fill this out prior to a      |
| MD experiment, to both justify the rationale and also keep a record for    |
| future reference.  An experiment that is not written up or used in further |
| work may as well not be run at all!!                                       |
|                                                                            |
| To aid this process we subscribe to 'Heilmeier's catechisms'               |

1) What are you trying to do? 


2) How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?


3) What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?


4) Who cares?


5) If you're successful, what difference will it make?


6) What are the risks and the payoffs?


7) How much will it cost?


8) How long will it take?


9) What are the midterm and final indicators to check for success?


10) What figures or representation can you make from the results?  Is this 
work going result in a publication. 


# Experimental Design: 
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Equilibrium stage?  

Size /temperature? 

Ensemble.  NVT / NPT?

Temperature control? 

Pressure control? 

Statistical sampling?

Analysis?  What will you measure from this?
