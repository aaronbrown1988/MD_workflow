This directory is designed to store files and scripts to change the 
'flavour' of the workflow from one to another.  The default flavour 
is NAMD for the BlueGene/Q.  

By running various scripts, one can change the workflow for running 
different 'flavours' of MD simulations such as gromacs or Amber, or
even just NAMD on x86. 

Simply run the appropriate script from this directory.
